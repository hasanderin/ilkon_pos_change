About
============
Currently in odoo pos when a customer gives order amount possible amount more so in that case we need to give a change to the customer. change amount currently visible at payment screen but once payment proceeds and pos screen change to receipt screen that time we can not find how much change needs to give to a customer. So this module makes pos cashier work easy to remember how much change needs to give to the customer.
